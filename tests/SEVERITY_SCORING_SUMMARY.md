# Automated Severity Scoring Implementation Summary

## Task 10.2: Implement Automated Severity Scoring

### Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive automated severity scoring system for the Code Quality Intelligence Agent. The system provides intelligent, context-aware severity assessment for code quality issues using machine learning-based classification, contextual adjustments, and business impact analysis.

### Components Implemented

#### 1. Severity Classifier (`severity_classifier.py`)
- **ML-based classification** with feature extraction from code quality issues
- **Feature engineering** including security, performance, complexity, and contextual features
- **Configurable scoring weights** based on domain expertise
- **Confidence calculation** based on feature availability and quality
- **Batch processing** capabilities for multiple issues
- **Model persistence** for saving/loading trained configurations

**Key Features:**
- Extracts 20+ features from issues including security indicators, performance markers, and code complexity
- Category-based base scoring (security: 0.8, performance: 0.6, maintainability: 0.4, etc.)
- Context-aware adjustments (test files get lower severity, main modules get higher)
- Confidence scoring based on feature completeness

#### 2. Contextual Scorer (`contextual_scorer.py`)
- **Project-level adjustments** based on industry, compliance, and criticality
- **File-level adjustments** considering role, coverage, and change patterns
- **Code-level adjustments** for execution frequency and data sensitivity
- **Multi-layered context integration** with confidence boosting

**Key Adjustments:**
- **Project Context**: Fintech/healthcare apps get 1.3x multiplier, production systems get 1.3x
- **File Context**: Authentication files get 1.4x, payment files get 1.5x, test files get 0.6x
- **Code Context**: Critical path execution gets 1.3x, data-sensitive code gets 1.2x

#### 3. Business Impact Assessor (`business_impact_assessor.py`)
- **Industry-specific impact calculation** with domain multipliers
- **Financial impact estimation** including revenue at risk and remediation costs
- **Business context integration** (company size, customer base, SLA requirements)
- **Impact category identification** (revenue loss, security breach, compliance violation, etc.)

**Key Capabilities:**
- Maps technical issues to business impact categories
- Calculates financial estimates based on ARPU and customer base
- Considers compliance requirements and brand sensitivity
- Provides priority scoring combining technical severity and business impact

#### 4. Scoring Engine (`scoring_engine.py`)
- **Orchestrates all scoring components** in a configurable pipeline
- **Comprehensive scoring results** with detailed reasoning and recommendations
- **Batch processing** with statistics and export capabilities
- **Fallback mechanisms** for robust operation
- **Configuration management** for flexible deployment

**Key Features:**
- Configurable component enabling/disabling
- Comprehensive scoring with severity, business impact, and priority
- Actionable recommendations based on scoring results
- Export capabilities for integration with other systems
- Statistics generation for monitoring and analysis

### Test Coverage

#### Comprehensive Test Suite (`test_severity_scoring.py`)
- **22 test cases** covering all components and integration scenarios
- **Unit tests** for individual component functionality
- **Integration tests** for end-to-end scoring workflows
- **Edge case handling** and error scenarios
- **Configuration and persistence testing**

**Test Categories:**
- Severity Classifier: Feature extraction, scoring algorithms, batch processing
- Contextual Scorer: Project/file/code context adjustments, confidence calculation
- Business Impact Assessor: Industry-specific impacts, financial estimation
- Scoring Engine: Comprehensive scoring, batch processing, statistics

### Key Achievements

#### 1. Intelligent Severity Assessment
- **Context-aware scoring** that considers project type, file role, and code characteristics

#### 2. Business-Aligned Prioritization
- **Financial impact estimation** translating technical issues to business metrics
- **Industry-specific adjustments** for fintech, healthcare, and other domains
- **Compliance-aware scoring** for regulated environments

#### 3. Actionable Recommendations
- **Severity-specific guidance** from info-level suggestions to critical alerts
- **Context-aware recommendations** considering project characteristics
- **Business impact communication** for stakeholder alignment

#### 4. Production-Ready Implementation
- **Robust error handling** with fallback mechanisms
- **Configurable components** for flexible deployment
- **Comprehensive logging** for monitoring and debugging
- **Export capabilities** for integration with existing workflows

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Severity Classification
```python
from code_quality_agent.scoring import SeverityClassifier

classifier = SeverityClassifier()
issue = {
    'category': 'security',
    'type': 'sql_injection',
    'description': 'SQL injection vulnerability in user input',
    'location': {'file_path': 'app/controllers/user.py'}
}

score = classifier.classify_severity(issue)
print(f"Severity: {score.level.value}, Confidence: {score.confidence:.2f}")
```

#### Comprehensive Scoring with Context
```python
from code_quality_agent.scoring import ScoringEngine, ScoringConfiguration

config = ScoringConfiguration(
    enable_ml_classification=True,
    enable_contextual_adjustment=True,
    enable_business_impact=True
)
engine = ScoringEngine(config)

context = {
    'project': {'type': 'fintech_app', 'domain': 'fintech', 'security_sensitive': True},
    'business': {'industry': 'fintech', 'company_size': 'enterprise'}
}

comprehensive_score = engine.score_issue(issue, context)
print(f"Priority Score: {comprehensive_score.priority_score:.2f}")
print(f"Business Impact: {comprehensive_score.business_impact:.2f}")
for rec in comprehensive_score.recommendations:
    print(f"- {rec}")
```
