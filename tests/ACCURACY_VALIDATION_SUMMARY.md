- Error handling and graceful degradation

## Technical Implementation

### **Accuracy Metrics Algorithm**

```python
# Multi-dimensional issue matching
def _calculate_match_confidence(expected, actual):
    confidence = 0.0
    # Category match (40% weight)
    # Severity match (20% weight)  
    # Type match (20% weight)
    # Line proximity (10% weight)
    # Description similarity (10% weight)
    return confidence
```

### **Vulnerability Pattern Matching**

```python
# Pattern-based vulnerability detection
builtin_patterns = {
    "sql_injection": [{
        "cwe_id": "CWE-89",
        "pattern": "string formatting in SQL query",
        "severity": "high"
    }]
}
```

### **Regression Detection Logic**

```python
# Multi-factor regression detection
def _detect_regression(baseline, current, issues_added, score_change):
    # Score regression (>5 point decrease)
    # New critical issues
    # Significant issue increase (>20%)
    return regression_detected
```

### **Explanation Quality Scoring**

```python
# Weighted quality assessment
quality_score = (
    readability_score * 0.3 + 
    completeness_score * 0.4 + 
    actionability_score * 0.3
)
```

## Usage Examples

### **CLI Usage**

```bash
# Validate accuracy against test fixtures
python -m code_quality_agent.cli.main validate accuracy /path/to/codebase --fixture security_issues

# Check vulnerability database matches
python -m code_quality_agent.cli.main validate vulnerabilities /path/to/codebase --verbose

# Test for regressions
python -m code_quality_agent.cli.main validate regression /path/to/codebase --baseline-version v1.0

# Assess explanation quality
python -m code_quality_agent.cli.main validate explanations --fixture performance_issues --verbose
```

### **Programmatic Usage**

```python
from code_quality_agent.validation import AccuracyMetrics, VulnerabilityValidator

# Calculate accuracy metrics
metrics = AccuracyMetrics(match_threshold=0.7)
result = metrics.calculate_metrics(expected_issues, actual_issues)
print(f"Precision: {result.precision:.3f}")
print(f"Recall: {result.recall:.3f}")
print(f"F1-Score: {result.f1_score:.3f}")

# Validate against vulnerabilities
validator = VulnerabilityValidator()
matches = validator.validate_against_vulnerabilities(detected_issues)
print(f"Found {len(matches)} vulnerability matches")
```
